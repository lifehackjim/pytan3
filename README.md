# PyTan: Python API for the Tanium Platform

PyTan is an all-in-one API wrapper for [Tanium](https://www.tanium.com) and is comprised of multiple modular layers that makes it easy to extend or add new functionality.

Since the inception of PyTan in October of 2014 it has grown in scope, complexity, and adoption. This version marks the fourth redesign, and it has vast improvements over the previous versions.

PyTan is actively maintained on GitHub, where the code is [always available](https://github.com/tanium/pytan3).

The [documentation for PyTan](https://pytan3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is available online thanks to [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/).
