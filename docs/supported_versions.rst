Supported Versions
#####################################

Supported Python versions
==========================================================
* 3.7.x
* 2.7.x

.. note::

   While Python 2.7.x is currently supported and tested, due to it's EOL of January 2020 it will be dropped from the testing category very soon.

   It will remain supported until the next major rewrite of PyTan or until pip drops support for Python 2.7.x, whichever comes first.

.. note::

   Other versions of Python could work beyond the tested versions.

   If PyTan fails to work with a supported version of Python, it will be fixed as long as the changes required do not introduce breaking changes to the PyTan API and do not break support for the supported versions.
