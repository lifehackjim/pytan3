Contributions are most welcome. If you are not familiar with how to contribute to a project on GitHub, feel free to read `this <https://akrabat.com/the-beginners-guide-to-contributing-to-a-github-project/>`_.

Since the foundation of PyTan is done, the next release of PyTan is focusing on Workflows. The design of how Workflows will be implemented is still being hashed out, but when it is finalized Workflow contributions will be very welcome.

The master branch is the stable branch, and should never have pull requests. Instead, pull requests should be performed against development version branches. The current version under development will always be named after the intended release followed by -dev, for example: ``3.1.0-dev``.
